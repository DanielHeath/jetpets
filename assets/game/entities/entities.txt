ex: walls / players / ball / powerups


entity = {
  id:      '1231231'
  body:    physics body
  sprite:  pixi sprite
}


they have a few required methods:
  - update
  - collision


the sequencer can handle their lifecycle:

  - game.add(entity)
    * adds the body to the physics engine
    * adds the sprite to pixi
    * starts tracking the entity
    
  - game.remove(entity)
    * pretty much the opposite


ideally, entities don't need to talk directly to other entities
or don't all need a reference to the game engine
but they can broadcast messages for the game to react, ex:

  - particles:explosion { count: 50, speed: 30, lifespan: 500 }
  - sound:play          { file: 'explosion.mp3' }
